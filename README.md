# üèõ Citizen Tech

Citizen Tech is a community of technologists exploring social and civic tech projects. I created this site to provide a space for people to participate in civic and social issues. The goal is to connect professionals with socially important work.

## Behind the scenes

Citizen Tech's website was bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for the frontend, [Airtable](https://airtable.com) to manage the job board, and hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It is extremely lightweight and is a useful process to get things started.

## Credits

Citizen Tech was built by [Niko](http://niko.pizza) at [Orbital NYC](https://orbital.nyc).
